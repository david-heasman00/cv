          <p><em>Bestselling Ghostwriter. Data Journalist at <strong><a href="https://land.tech/">LandTech</a></strong>.</em></p>
          <p>I am a <a href="https://blog.land.tech/author/david-heasman">Data Journalist at LandTech</a>, the fastest growing PropTech company in the UK.</p>
          <p>I love all things data storytelling and science communication,
            and have pursued mastery in not just storytelling, but data analysis, data science, and data visualization.
          </p>
          <p>
            My work has been featured in The Times, <a href="https://www.propertyweek.com/blogs-sponsored-content/use-class-updates-the-numbers-behind-the-changes/5110158.article">Property Week</a>, and been submitted to the Australian Parliament. Previous to this I was a bestselling ghostwriter, and got a BSc in Physics.
          </p>
          <p>
            I read a lot, enjoy the bars and leisures that London has to offer, and enjoy language learning (even though I'm bad at it).
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh. Video games are fun too.
